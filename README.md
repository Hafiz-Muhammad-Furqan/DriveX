## 🛠️ What I Built With

Here's the tech stack I chose for this project:

### Backend

Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Real-time updates use Socket.IO, authentication via JWT, and payments handled securely with Stripe.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React and set up using Vite for faster development. React Router handles navigation, and MapLibre GL powers the mapping features. Styling is done with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern UI. Real-time updates are managed with Socket.IO-client.

## 🚀 Want to Run it Locally?

If you want to play around with the code, here's how to get it running on your machine:

### You'll Need

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- MongoDB installed locally or a MongoDB Atlas account
- API keys for Gomaps.pro and Stripe (I used free tier for development)

### Setup Steps

1. First, grab the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hafiz-Muhammad-Furqan/DriveX.git
cd DriveX
```

2. Set up the backend:

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

3. Set up the frontend:

```bash
cd ../Frontend
npm install
```

4. Create your environment files:

You'll need two `.env` files - one for backend, one for frontend:

Backend `.env`:

```env
PORT=3000
DB_CONNECT=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret
GOMAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Frontend `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
```

5. Fire it up!

Start the backend:

```bash
cd Backend
npm start
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

And you're all set! The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`
